# Updating the file



## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
#getData <- read.csv(unzip("activity.zip"))


```

## Get and clean data
```{r}
getData<-read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses=c('numeric','Date','numeric'))
goodData<-na.omit(getData)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
daySteps<-aggregate(goodData$steps, by=list(goodData$date), sum)
hist(daySteps$x, breaks=20, xlab="Steps", ylab="Days")
mean(daySteps$x)
median(daySteps$x)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
